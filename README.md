# War: The Card Game

Wanna play a card game of luck with your friends, but don't have a deck of cards? I got you covered! I present to you...*War! The Card Game!* Yes, yes, yes, the card game *War* has probably been around longer than I've been alive, but here's a cool little web application to play it virtually!

## Description:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML and CSS were used for the front-end content and styling of the app, however, JavaScript is where this app shines! The local storage implementation means your deck won't be switched to a new deck mid-game. Also, we've written quite a few conditionals to ensure the proper winner is displayed for each pair of cards pulled. Enjoy!

## Lessons Learned:

Similarly to my ISBN Book Finder apps, this card game app was integral in learning how to utilize local storage in my applications. While the HTML and CSS aspects were great front-end reviews, implementing local storage required quite a bit of heavy lifting and research. I won't lie, I struggled in getting local storage to work properly here, but I'm proud to have pushed through by utilizing my resources. The biggest lesson here is: Don't be afraid to reach out to colleagues for help. They've probably struggled on the same road as you.
